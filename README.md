# Removing-Random-noise-from-Audio-signal

The main purpose of this project is to filter out random noise from a dual-channel audio signal.

When an audio signal has to be decoded or understood at the receiver end, it has to be free of noise. As noise-less transmission is practically not possible, this project intends to propose a sequential procedure to make the received signal noise-free to the maximum extent possible. Audio filtering plays a key role in many applications like speech recognition. This project work assumes the noise to be random in most of the cases. The proposed sequential method to filter out the noise was verified by implementing the code in Matlab R2019a.
